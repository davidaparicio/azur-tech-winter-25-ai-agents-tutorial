# AI Agents Tutorial - Telecom Valley Winter Tech 2025

This repository contains a tutorial on building AI agents using LangChain and LangGraph, presented at Telecom Valley Winter Tech 2025.

## 📚 Contents

This tutorial consists of three progressive notebooks:

1. **`intro_langchain.ipynb`** - Introduction to LangChain fundamentals

   - Understanding basic building blocks (LLM, prompts, chains)
   - Building simple question/answer pipelines
   - Creating a simplified RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system

2. **`intro_langgraph.ipynb`** - Introduction to LangGraph

   - Understanding StateGraph concepts
   - Building workflows as graphs
   - Creating a simple conversational agent

3. **`agents_meteo_calendrier.ipynb`** - ReAct Agents with LangGraph
   - Building a ReAct agent using two tools: weather and calendar
   - Implementing the same behavior with LangGraph (explicit workflow)
   - Comparing ReAct vs LangGraph approaches
   - Observability with LangSmith

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Telecom-Valley-Winter-Tech-2025/ai-agents-tutorial/english
```

2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -U langchain-core langchain-openai langgraph langchain-text-splitters
```

For visualization features (Mermaid PNG generation):

```bash
pip install -U grandalf
```

### Environment Variables

Before running the notebooks, you need to set up your API keys as environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the `ai-agents-tutorial/english` directory or export them in your shell:

```bash
# Required: OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"

# Optional: LangSmith for observability (used in agents_meteo_calendrier.ipynb)
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your-langchain-api-key-here"
export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="your-project-name"
export LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
```

**Important**: Never commit your API keys to the repository. The notebooks have been configured to use environment variables - make sure to fill in your own keys before running.

## 📖 Usage

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the notebooks in order:

   - Start with `intro_langchain.ipynb` for LangChain basics
   - Then `intro_langgraph.ipynb` for LangGraph concepts
   - Finally `agents_meteo_calendrier.ipynb` for the complete agent example

3. Make sure your environment variables are set before running cells that require API keys.

## 📄 Slides

**Note**: The `slides.pdf` file is included for convenience and sharing purposes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: Framework for building applications with LLMs
- **LangGraph**: Library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Language model used throughout the tutorial
- **LangSmith**: Observability platform for LLM applications (optional)

## 📝 Notes

- The weather and calendar tools in `agents_meteo_calendrier.ipynb` are simulated (no external API calls)
- All notebooks include English comments and explanations
- The tutorial demonstrates both implicit (ReAct) and explicit (LangGraph) agent workflows
